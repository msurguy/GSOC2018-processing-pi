# Overview

This website summarizes the work I've completed as a student working with the [Processing Foundation](https://processingfoundation.org/) through [Google Summer of Code 2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/).  

First of all, I’d like to say HUGE Thanks to the Processing Foundation and to Google for making Google Summer of Code a reality for students like me. Specifically I’d like to thank my mentor [Gottfried Haider](https://twitter.com/mrgohai) for spending countless hours working with me on the style and content of [Processing for Pi](http://pi.processing.org/) website and for giving me a new perspective on open source community. I feel like I’ve grown a lot as an engineer and as a contributor to the mission of Processing Foundation.

Google Summer of Code 2018 ran from May 14 to August 14 2018. In these three months I've worked with my mentor to create a brand new website and wrote a few comprehensive tutorials for using [Processing](http://processing.org/) (software) on Raspberry Pi single board computers.

The result of my work is [hosted on Github](https://github.com/processing/processing-pi-website) and is accessible at [Pi.processing.org](http://pi.processing.org).

## History and Context

In April 2018 I've applied to work with the Processing Foundation by submitting a project proposal (you can read it [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SShi0Rjh6jHl6s_BIB5TBxKEygU1Knr5GQ1pwikIji8/edit)) for a set of tutorials covering various aspects of running Processing on Raspberry Pi.

The proposal was focused around developing comprehensive tutorials that lower the barrier to entry for people using Raspberry Pi and Processing together. 

There's an interesting story about how I discovered Processing Foundation as the organization that I wanted to partner with.
