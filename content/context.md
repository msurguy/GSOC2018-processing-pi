# How I got into GSoC 2018

As I was in grad school, I had an assignment in one of the classes. That assignment was to write a research essay about the history of some technology that I considered interesting. After careful consideration, I chose Processing as one of the technologies that I'd like to learn about, specifically about its history.

I set out to dig deep into the roots of Processing, finding out who was involved in creating it, who was contributing, what other technologies served as a predecessor to Processing and after three days of intensive research I was able to write an essay titled "The History of Processing".

You can read my essay here: [The History of Processing ](https://maxoffsky.com/research/research-essay-the-history-of-processing)

Shortly after publishing, the essay made rounds around the web:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Research essay: The History of Processing <a href="https://t.co/YRi8z0a4QE">https://t.co/YRi8z0a4QE</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/msurguy?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@msurguy</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/processing?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#processing</a> <a href="https://t.co/I9FSPxh2U5">pic.twitter.com/I9FSPxh2U5</a></p>&mdash; algoritmic (@algoritmic) <a href="https://twitter.com/algoritmic/status/976883539860951040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 22, 2018</a></blockquote>

While working on the essay, I discovered that Processing was a participant in Google Summer of Code for a few years and that peaked my interest. I started looking at the website that lists project ideas that would be a good candidate for GSoC 2018 and found out that help is needed for Raspberry Pi related content and developing a website. These are my strengths, so I applied with this proposal, which got accepted:

Before GSoC officially started, I was able to do some user research to understand the needs and the frustrations of people that are looking for the type of content that I wanted to produce.
